## Story:
Starts as the character is in an hidden factory where they make the character fall, slid and take the pictures to sell the signs for the respective hazards, the factory fully covers the cost of the damage and has an inbuilt multi-specialty hospital to fix anything they have broken.
As days goes by the character feels this is wrong and not to mention the hospital and money doesnt take the pain he feels into the account, so he tries to escape from the factory.
after struggling a bit he does escape from the factory. experiencing the outside world for the first time. this makes him feel even strongly to get away from the fac and people there. but those guys in the fac cant let our guy escape since he knows how everything works. 

So this game is level based game, so we go to each continent and there would be factory in each section in the continent, our goal is to stop the factories to prevent further damages and also to fight back / escape from them (fac).

## Gameplay:

there would be 7 chapters for each continent and each chap has the major places / countries. each major place would have special assets (game level designed with accordance to their asthetics of the place). each place has few levels (signs to conquer)

roadways, water, air, railways etc

the game is a fast paced, procedurally generated to each playthorugh of the same level feels different and 2.5 D so user can controll only motion in 2 axes and the 3rd axis is determined by the motion of the camera through out the level. there are normal traps and puzzles we need to solve (some are timed, some not) along with quick time events.

there is a world system that tracks the player's progress as we conquer each sign the world changes as that sign is no longer available(success or level win), if we fail a level (the game (factory guys) capture the image exactly how u fell and will send that to make signs in the world or section) anyway make as the player progress in each area the world is taken to the chaos caused by lack of danger / hazard signs making our player from the guy escaping to a guy destroying lives due to his thinking of signs, where the part of the game comes to solve this (a sequel)

## Platform
1. Windows, linux(, mac?)
2. Android (at later time but yes (maybe ios too?))

## Quirky things
1. This game is going to implement many quality of life things and also some fun things to mess with the player (can be turned off, or can you?)
2. along with achievements (some are hidden or are they?)
3. save games slots
4. save lock to prevent others from playing through your save
5. temp walkthrough (no saving (is this hardcore variant?))
6. interesting shaders (custom user coded shaders too, if they want to use that for funny purposes)
7. QTE's also have good and bad things, there is a photo system where you have to take some images in QTE to get achivements
